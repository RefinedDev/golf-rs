A top-down mini golf game made using the [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) library and Rust.

# How to play
Hold your Left Mouse Button to build velocity for the golf ball, move your mouse around to rotate the ball. The further the mouse from the golf ball, the further it will go. Release to launch.

Use the walls and obstacles to bounce the ball off of, perform cool trickshots.
